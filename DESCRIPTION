Description: Since baseballr failed, I decided to write a package to scrape PITCHf/x dataset myself. This package provides a main function get_pitchfx to obtain the PITCHf/x data. It makes use of mlbstat api to obtain the fundamental dataset and do some manual cleaning to fetch the PITCHf/x dataset. You can either pass specific game_id or date to use this function.
